# :blue_book: Template for READMEs

This serves as a template for new READMEs and should be used as a guideline for existing ones.

Use [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to lint the README. This is part of the *Doc Writer* Visual Studio Code Profile.

Use backticks for `filenames` and `directories`, `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`, `executables`, `keys` and `--command-line-arguments`.

The title must be the name of the repository and can be preceded by an [emoji](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) that has something to do with the repository .

For large README files a table of content can be added, which can be automated with the [Auto Markdown TOC extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huntertran.auto-markdown-toc):

## :construction: or :hammer_and_wrench: Prerequisites or Setup

You have to add clone instructions if a simple pull is not sufficient. For example if submodules have to be checked out.

Add instructions to software that has to be installed on the machine to run the code or link to another repository or other documentation which covers the setup. Ofter used examples are [ansible repo](https://github.com/skillslab/ansible) and [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
